Feature: test app css (tacss) check for login
    As a react-app CSS Designer
    I want to verify css effects in the react-app
    So I have confidence that the user the desired UX effect

    Given I am at the "list" page

    Scenario: list-repo css
        Then  I should see <element> with an attribute <react-app-CSS-class> containing value <value>

Examples:
| element | react-app-CSS-class | value       |
| button  | class               | sign-in     |
